# Dallas County Community College District
Making the Dallas County Community College District data more useful

## Goals

To open up the data from the DCCCD website, to provide DCCCD with useful suggestions to make their data more helpful / accessible, and to help provide more useful information to Dallas County residents and DCCCD students. Ideas? Suggestions? Create an issue.

## Projects

#### Data

**Check Register CSV's**

DCCCD posts PDF's of their check register on their website regularly. We've extracted the data for the last several years and posted it under public/data as CSV files. Soon this will be moved to datahub.io.


#### Tools

**Check Register Navigator**

This tool will provide a visual representation of the DCCCD Check Register and allow Dallas County residents and DCCCD students to sort and filter the check register to see how their tax dollars and tuition are being spent.
 While this is a subset of the DCCCD project for now, ideally this would become a stand-alone project that could be used by any local government to make their check register more accessible.
